# Personal expenses app
The attached files **DO NOT** work as a standalone project, they are just the code I wrote (lib folder), pubspecs (dependencies) and the assets (fonts to add style to the app).  

To give the app a try:
-  [Download the Flutter SDK and Android Studio](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).
-  Run "flutter create" on the terminal, or open up the Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + 'P') in VS Code and type "Flutter: New Project".
-  Once it's done creating the new project, add the assets folder in your new project, and replace the lib folder and the pubspec.yaml with the ones I provide in this repo.
-  Run the app **without debugging** on an Android Virtual Device (first of all you need to have an AVD up and running before executing the app).
-  That's it!
